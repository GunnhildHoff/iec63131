# Yggdrasil AML library

Yggdrasil branch contains library and tools for Yggdrasil project specifics

## Scope of work (SOW) for Yggdrasil branch

Development of Yggdrasil specific AML library parts:
- Context & Hiding
- Shutdown Hierarchies
- Project specific function blocks and elementary functions
- Fire & Gas specifics

## Library files purpose and composition

- NorsokSCDLibrary.aml is common iec63131 library. No project specific additions are allowed in this file
  - Changes in the common standard library shall be implemented in `main` branch, and then merged to `Yggdrasil` (reverse direction not allowed, since it would complicate things)
- YggdrasilPartialLibrary.aml contains Yggdrasil project specific additions to library
- YggdrasilAMLLibrary.aml is combined iec63131 and Yggdrasil library (generated by helper-script, not to be edited manually).

## Usage in project
The following bare minimum guidelines should be included in project guidelines:  
- Any terminal that ends with a number should be understood to extensible, meaning that multiples of that terminal may be instantiated (eg, `FlowIn1` means that it is allowed to add `FlowIn2`, ..., `FlowIn<n>`)
  - This concept should be explicitly stated for each type/terminal where it occurs in the project's guideline documents (repeat as necessary)
- Attribute `AlarmToHide1` of SystemUnitClass "Context" is extensible, ie, add attributes to hide more alarms: `AlarmToHide2`, etc.
Hierarchical compositions **shall** follow these rules (which cannot be encoded into the AML library itself):
- InternalLink shall not be used between documents (Yggdrasil rule, maybe not a general Norsok AML Library rule)
- FunctionBlock instances are not allowed outside parent `InternalElement` with `RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/FunctionBlockStructure"`
- Elementary function (EFB) instances are not allowed outside parent `InternalElement` with `RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/ElementaryFunctionStructure"`
  - This requirement applies for all document types where EFBs may be used
- In general DocumentElementStructure children should be from library DocumentElementClassLibrary
- In general ReferenceStructure children should be from library ReferenceClassLibrary (TODO: any exceptions? what about RefMCC?)
- Example best practice hierarchy (informative):
```xml
  <InstanceHierarchy ...>
    <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/DocumentStructure">
      <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="DocumentClassLibrary/SCD">
        <InternalElement Name="Notes" ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/DocumentElementStructure">
          <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="DocumentElementClassLibrary/Note">
          ...
        <InternalElement Name="PageConnectors" ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/ReferenceStructure">
          <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="ReferenceClassLibrary/ToDestination/SignalOffPage">
        <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/FunctionBlockStructure">
          <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="FunctionBlockLibrary/NorsokFunctionBlockClass/MA">
          <InternalLink ... />
        <InternalLink ... />
        <InternalLink ... />
      <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="DocumentClassLibrary/SequenceDocument">
        <InternalElement Name="SequenceStructure" ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="StructureClassLibrary/SequenceStructure">
          <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="SequenceElementLibrary/StandardSequenceElementClass/Action">
          <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="SequenceElementLibrary/StandardSequenceElementClass/Step">
          <InternalLink ... />
      <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="DocumentClassLibrary/SequenceDocument">
      <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="DocumentClassLibrary/SCD">
      <InternalElement ... RefBaseSystemUnitPath="DocumentClassLibrary/ShutdownHierarchy">
        <!-- same structure as SCDs basically -->
```
- Context&Hiding Transition driving logic should be encoded using elementary logic (elements from ElementaryFunctionLibrary). Output from driving logic should be connected to X input of Transition. High level on X input initiates transition.

## Tools

helper-scripts/CombineYggdrasilLibrary.ps1 script is to be used to combine YggdrasilPartialLibrary.aml and NorsokSCDLibrary.aml into YggdrasilAMLLibrary.aml
Resulting YggdrasilAMLLibrary.aml file should be manually checked (diff with NorsokSCDLibrary.aml) to ensure correct combining
